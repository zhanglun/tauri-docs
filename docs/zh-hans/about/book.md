### Introduction

In 2020, the manufacture of native-apps has become easier and more accessible than ever before. All the same, beginners and seasoned developers alike are confronted with tough choices in a rapidly changing landscape of security and privacy. This is especially true in the semi-trusted environment of user devices.

Tauri takes the guesswork out of the equation, as it was designed from the ground up to embrace new paradigms of secure development and creative flexibility that leverage the language features of Rust and lets you build an app using any frontend framework you like. Find out how you can design, build, audit and deploy tiny, fast, robust, and secure native applications for the major Desktop and Mobile platforms, all from the exact same codebase and in record time - without even needing to know the Rust programming language.

Authors Daniel and Lucas, the architects behind Tauri take you on a journey from theory to execution, during which you will learn why Tauri was built and how it works under the hood. Together with guest personalities that specialize in Open Source, DevOps, Security and Enterprise Architecture, this book also presents discourse-formatted philosophical discussions and open-source sustainability viewpoints from which your next-gen apps will profit - and your users will benefit.

In this book you will follow the authors in the iterative evolution of a real project from conception to distribution - all with commentary, complete code resources, built, and packaged Native Apps for reference and staged Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges that progress in difficulty as your comprehension of the system grows.

### About the Topic

Tauri is a brand new way to make cross-platform native-apps for web, desktop and mobile. At this very moment, the pre-alpha version of this MIT licensed community-based software is being prepared for public release: https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri

Tauri introduces novel methods for WebView integration and innovative patterns for robust threat evasion. The 1.0 release will ship with a multipurpose white-box analyzer and decompiler for any kind of binary and an integrated CLI for ingesting any type of HTML; which, when combined, provides developers and security teams with a holistic platform that has never existed as a single unit before.

Tauri bridges communities and opens up new opportunities for everyone from the front end developer all the way to the low-level security and network administrators. Due to this level of complexity and robustness, it is important to publish a reference guide that will necessarily be updated as major versions are released.

### What you will learn

By the end of this book you will understand:

- The method and reasoning behind the design of Tauri
- The options you have when building with Tauri
- That having a moral compass is possible in software development
- Why the Rust language makes the most sense as a binding and application layer
- Why Electron, Cordova, React Native, Capacitor and others are no longer the best choice
- Why a binary review is important

And you will be able to:

- Transform a simple website project into a Tauri Native-App
- Make a variety of Tauri Application Types based on the main Patterns
- Decompile and analyze your App for Security Issues
- Publish your App to a variety of App Stores
- Read and write Rust code

### Stuff you'll get if you preorder

- Access to a real demo App built for all platforms available at respective stores (that includes CTF Flags).
- Exclusive One-Pager cheat sheets made available for each section of the book, including the Appendices.
- Early access to videos / webcasts.
- Discounted participation in the “Capture the Flag” event hosted at the launch of the book.
