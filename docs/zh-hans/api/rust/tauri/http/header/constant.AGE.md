```rs
pub const AGE: HeaderName;
```

Expand description

Indicates the time in seconds the object has been in a proxy cache.

The Age header is usually close to zero. If it is Age: 0, it was probably just fetched from the origin server; otherwise It is usually calculated as a difference between the proxyâ€™s current date and the Date general header included in the HTTP response.
