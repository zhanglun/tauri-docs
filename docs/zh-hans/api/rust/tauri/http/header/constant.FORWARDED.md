```rs
pub const FORWARDED: HeaderName;
```

Expand description

Contains information from the client-facing side of proxy servers that is altered or lost when a proxy is involved in the path of the request.

The alternative and de-facto standard versions of this header are the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto headers.

This header is used for debugging, statistics, and generating location-dependent content and by design it exposes privacy sensitive information, such as the IP address of the client. Therefore the userâ€™s privacy must be kept in mind when deploying this header.
