title: Introduction

This part of the documentation is dedicated to learning how to use Tauri.

Tauri provides a [CLI](/docs/api/cli), a Rust API, and a [JavaScript API](/docs/api/js/index) that you can use in your project. Because raw docs can be quite scary to newcomers (especially people who have never played with Rust before), we've created this "learn by example" section.

Here you will find guides and techniques to start a new project or add to your own project in order to fulfill your goals.
