### Optional dependencies:

- `libappindicator`: needed to use the system tray feature.
- `patchelf` and `librsvg`: needed to bundle `AppImage`.

## 2. Node.js Runtime and Package Manager&nbsp;<Icon title="control-skip-forward" color="warning"/>

### Node.js (npm included)

We recommend using nvm to manage your Node.js runtime. It allows you to easily switch versions and update Node.js.

```sh
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```

<Alert title="Note">
We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh" target="_blank">download link</a>.
</Alert>

Once nvm is installed, close and reopen your terminal, then install the latest version of Node.js and npm:

```sh
$ nvm install node --latest-npm
$ nvm use node
```

If you have any problems with nvm, please consult their <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">project readme</a>.

### Optional Node.js Package Manager

You may want to use an alternative to npm:

- <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started" target="_blank">Yarn</a>, is preferred by Tauri's team
- <a href="https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation" target="_blank">pnpm</a>

## 3. Rustc and Cargo Package Manager&nbsp;<Icon title="control-skip-forward" color="warning"/>

The following command will install <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank">rustup</a>, the official installer for <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust</a>.

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

<Alert title="Note">
We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere <a href="https://sh.rustup.rs" target="_blank">download link</a>.
</Alert>

To make sure that Rust has been installed successfully, run the following command:

```sh
$ rustc --version
latest update on 2019-12-19, rust version 1.40.0
```

You may need to restart your terminal if the command does not work.

## 4. For Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Users&nbsp;<Icon title="info-alt" color="info"/>

In order to run a graphical application with WSL, you need to download **one** of these X servers: Xming, Cygwin X, and vcXsrv.
Since vcXsrv has been used internally, it's the one we recommend to install.

### WSL Version 1

Open the X server and then run `export DISPLAY=:0` in the terminal. You should now be able to run any graphical application via the terminal.

### WSL Version 2

You'll need to run a command that is slightly more complex than WSL 1: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0` and you need to add `-ac` to the X server as an argument. Note: if for some reason this command doesn't work you can use an alternative command such as: `export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | sed 's/.* //g'):0` or you can manually find the Address using `cat /etc/resolve.conf | grep nameserver`.

<Alert type="info" title="Note">

Don't forget that you'll have to use the "export" command anytime you want to use a graphical application, for each newly opened terminal.

You can download some examples to try with `sudo apt-get install x11-apps`. xeyes is always a good one. It can be handy when troubleshooting WSL issues.
